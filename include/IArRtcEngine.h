     the `COMMUNICATION` profile prioritizes smoothness, while the `LIVE_BROADCASTING` profile prioritizes video quality (requiring a higher bitrate). We recommend setting the bitrate mode as #STANDARD_BITRATE to address this difference.

     By default, this callback is disabled. You can enable it by calling the \ref IRtcEngine::enableAudioVolumeIndication(int, int, bool) "enableAudioVolumeIndication" method.
     Once enabled, this callback is triggered at the set interval, regardless of whether a user speaks or not.

     The SDK triggers two independent `onAudioVolumeIndication` callbacks at one time, which separately report the volume information of the local user and all the remote speakers. 
     For more information, see the detailed parameter descriptions.

     @note
     - To enable the voice activity detection of the local user, ensure that you set `report_vad`(true) in the `enableAudioVolumeIndication` method.
     - Calling the \ref ar::rtc::IRtcEngine::muteLocalAudioStream "muteLocalAudioStream" method affects the SDK's behavior:
        - If the local user calls the \ref ar::rtc::IRtcEngine::muteLocalAudioStream "muteLocalAudioStream" method, the SDK stops triggering the local user's callback.
        - 20 seconds after a remote speaker calls the *muteLocalAudioStream* method, the remote speakers' callback excludes this remote user's information; 20 seconds after all remote users call the *muteLocalAudioStream* method, the SDK stops triggering the remote speakers' callback.
     - An empty @p speakers array in the *onAudioVolumeIndication* callback suggests that no remote user is speaking at the moment.

     @param speakers A pointer to AudioVolumeInfo:
     - In the local user's callback, this struct contains the following members:
       - `uid` = 0, 
       - `volume` = `totalVolume`, which reports the sum of the voice volume and audio-mixing volume of the local user, and
       - `vad`, which reports the voice activity status of the local user.
     - In the remote speakers' callback, this array contains the following members:
       - `uid` of the remote speaker,
       - `volume`, which reports the sum of the voice volume and audio-mixing volume of each remote speaker, and
       - `vad` = 0.
       
       An empty speakers array in the callback indicates that no remote user is speaking at the moment.
     @param speakerNumber Total number of speakers. The value range is [0, 3].
     - In the local user’s callback, `speakerNumber` = 1, regardless of whether the local user speaks or not.
     - In the remote speakers' callback, the callback reports the IDs and volumes of the three loudest speakers when there are more than three remote users in the channel, and `speakerNumber` = 3.
     @param totalVolume Total volume after audio mixing. The value ranges between 0 (lowest volume) and 255 (highest volume).
     - In the local user’s callback, `totalVolume` is the sum of the voice volume and audio-mixing volume of the local user.
     - In the remote speakers' callback, `totalVolume` is the sum of the voice volume and audio-mixing volume of all the remote speakers.
